## Project Title
Customer Behavior Analytics

## Brief One Line Summary
Comprehensive sales analytics of Istanbul malls to uncover customer trends, revenue drivers, and actionable retail strategies.

## Overview
This project delivers a structured analysis of retail sales data collected from shopping malls in Istanbul. The core objective is to provide stakeholders with data-driven insights into customer demographics, sales performance, and payment behavior, ultimately enabling better inventory planning, targeted marketing, and revenue optimization.

The intended audience includes retail executives, category managers, data analysts, and decision-makers responsible for strategic planning and operational efficiency. The deliverable is a set of analytical outputs and an interactive dashboard to monitor KPIs in real time.

By productionizing this workflow, the project ensures stakeholders can identify revenue leakage, adapt promotions based on customer demographics, and benchmark mall performance against peers. The pipeline is modular, transparent, and reproducible, ensuring governance and auditability of insights.

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses operating in Istanbul malls face revenue stagnation due to limited visibility into customer preferences, inventory inefficiencies, and fragmented marketing execution. The absence of consolidated analytics leads to lost opportunities in high-performing categories and misallocation of resources. Success for this project is defined by improved decision-making across KPIs including category-level sales growth, customer retention rate, and operational efficiency.
